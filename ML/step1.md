When signed up or logged in, you will enter the Azure ML Studio.

## Begin an experiment

We start by creating an experiment. Click on the big plus button at the bottom of the screen to bring the Samples selector in view. We will use an existing sample as a starting point.

Search for `Sample 5` which should give you one result as visualized below.
